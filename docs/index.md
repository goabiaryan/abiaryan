My name is Abi. I am a Computer Scientist working extensively in machine learning to make the software systems smarter. Over the past six years, my focus has been building machine learning models for various applications including voice tech, recommendation systems, geopositional apps etc.

I am deeply fascinated by deep tech and its applications in various industries. To that end, I have been lucky enough to be a VC Fellow with [Laconia Capital.](https://www.laconiacapitalgroup.com/) In my free time, you would find me working on the content strategy at [MLOps Community](https://mlops.community/) focusing specifically on the podcast or discovering new B2B MLOps startups seeking pre-seed and seed funding. I’m best reached via [email](mailto: abi@abiaryan.com). I’m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration. 

Prior to that, I also attended [Insight](https://insightfellows.com/data-science) in Toronto as a Data Science Fellow and was a Visiting Research Scholar at UCLA under [Dr. Judea Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html) where I worked in AutoML, MultiAgent Systems and Emotion Recognition. At school, I majored in mathematics with minors in statistics and computer science with some finance and mangement courses loosely sprinkled in.

I am, foremost, driven by the goal to create personalized humane-agents that can influence and alter human decision making, but subsconsciously, also the nagging desire to leave the world a slightly better place than I found it. A tad bit geeky and a gadget lover at heart, I am equally fascinated by large-scale engineering application design as well as low level computer hardware engineering including microprocessors, crafting compilers, integrated chip design etc.

I am also passionate about communities and helping self-taught engineers get into technical careers.

##### Interested in hearing about Data Infrastructure, ML Systems, and new startups/research papers/tools in the MLOps space?

I send out Data Driven Babe. Feel free to sub. No spamming. Just one letter a month.
