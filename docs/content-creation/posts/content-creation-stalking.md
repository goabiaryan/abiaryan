Humans have always generated content for various purposes. Sometimes education, sometimes entertainment and other times purely a self-indulgent creative outlet. But, never before YouTube has creating and distributing content as an individual publisher been so easy. It is this ease that baits several professions out of their nine-to-five jobs and into a new role called "Youtuber" or "TikToker" or "Twitch Streamer".

My fascination with content has been as long as my existence as a way to educate, inform, and a medium to influence and transform people and culture at scale.

Until one day, stalkers show up on your door and it gets scary.
